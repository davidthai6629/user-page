One of my favorite foods:
![French Fries](https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/54659021.cms?imgsize=275086&width=800&height=800)

Potatoes are the best, there are so many ways to prepare them. Some of them are:
- Baked
- Fried
- Mashed
- Roasted

Obviously, there is a ranking. My Top 3 are:
1. Fried Potato (French Fries)
2. Mashed Potatoes
3. Roasted Potatoes
